Accessory's description	: This accessory is an almost complete replacement for the default Q3:A Plasma Gun.
                                                          It is intended to resemble the Plasma Gun from the original Doom games.

                                                          PARTS REPLACED:
                                                          Plasmagun model
                                                          Plasmagun "flash" skin
                                                          Plasmagun projectile skin
                                                          Plasmagun damage/mark skin
                                                          PARTS ADDED:
                                                          New Plasmagun skins 
                                                          New Plasmagun shaders
